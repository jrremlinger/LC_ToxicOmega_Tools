# ToxicOmega Tools

*Commands triggered using the in-game chat. The main purpose of this mod is for exploring the technical aspects of the game and testing other mods.*

Some important notes:
* All commands only register if you are the host.
* It is not required for all players to have the mod installed, but it may lead to desyncs if a player doesn't have it.
* Text chat will stay enabled while dead if you are the host.
* Only the beginning of commands as well as player/item/enemy names are required, the closest matching item will be selected.
* There are several ways to target different entities/areas when running commands:
  * The network ID (shown in list command and hud) can be used to target already existing items/enemies.
  * $: Using "$" indicates random/natural destination. For teleporting this will act as an inverse-teleporter putting the teleport target randomly inside the factory. For spawning items it will choose a normal scrap spawnpoint. For enemies it will either use vents or outside spawnpoints depending on the type of enemy.
  * !: Using "!" chooses the ships terminal as a target. This is only applicable for teleportation.
  * @(num): Using "@" followed by a number will choose the waypoint with that index as the target.
  * #(num): Using "#" followed by a number will choose the player with that Client ID as the target.
  * +(num) & -(num): Using "+" or "-" followed by a number will choose the location in front of or behind the local player (or the player being spectated if you are dead). Using "+" without a number after will shoot a RayCast to use the location of wherever you are looking at no matter how far it is..
  * Typing the beginning of a players name will target that player.
